# PageRank-Algorithm
This is an algorithm used to calculate PageRank of websites in a webgraph.
It creates the matrix of probabilities and calculates matrix-vector multiplication to get the pagerank of each website. This program is also capable of dealing with the case of calculating the PageRank even with the existence of dangling nodes in any webgraph.

Created this project for my course: Analysis & Design of Algorithms in Fall 2021 at AUC.
